Build a website for Markley Marine Surveying using the same color scheme, fonts, and nautical / marine theme as the current site (markleymarinesurveying.com). The goal is to modernize design, improve usability, and enhance SEO, while adding new features: a Gallery page and a Quote / Service Estimate form.

Features and Pages to include:

Home page
  • Hero section with a strong image of a vessel, overlaid title ("Pre‑Purchase & Insurance Marine Surveyors in Florida") and CTA button ("Get a Quote" / "Schedule a Survey").
  • Brief intro about Markley Marine Surveying, certification credentials (SAMS, ABYC etc.), geographic coverage (Florida coasts).
  • Highlights of services offered (pre‑purchase, insurance, appraisal, inspections).
  • “Why Choose Us” section: credibility, standards, experience, unbiased surveys.
  • Testimonials / case‑snippet (if possible).
  • Footer with contact info, service areas, social / legal (if any).

Services page
  • Individual sections for each service: Pre‑Purchase Survey; Insurance Survey; Appraisal Survey; Vessel Inspection; Consultations.
  • For each: what’s involved, what clients can expect, benefits.
  • CTA to quote form or contact.

Gallery page
  • Grid display of recent boats/vessels that have been surveyed.
  • For each gallery item: 1‑3 images, vessel type, year/make/model (if available), location, date of service, what survey was done.
  • Ability to add new items easily via some content file / admin panel.
  • Load images efficiently (optimize size, lazy load, alt text describing vessel + service).

About Us
  • Background of business, credentials (SAMS, ABYC, Chapman School etc.), mission & values.
  • Possibly a photo of the surveyor / team.
  • Why clients can trust them.

Contact & Quote form page (or combined Contact/Quote)
  • Contact info: phone, email, possibly map (if location address).
  • Quote / Estimate request form with fields: name, email, phone, vessel type & details, service type needed, location, desired date/time, optional images, comments.
  • Submission handling: send to business email + confirmation message to user.
